    Convolutional Neural Network
        Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of
        :term:`Deep Neural Networks <Deep Neural Network>` most commonly applied
        to analyzing visual imagery.

        .. seealso:: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network

    Deep Neural Network
        Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are :term:`Neural Networks <Neural Network>`
        with more than 2 layers between the input and output layers.

        .. seealso:: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning

    Hyperparameter
        Parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. By
        contrast, the values of other parameters are derived via training.

        .. seealso:: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning)

    Learning Rate
        The learning rate or step size in machine learning is a
        :term:`hyperparameter` which determines to what extent newly acquired
        information overrides old information

        .. seealso:: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_rate

    Machine Learning
        Scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer
        systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using
        explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.

    MatConvNet
        MatConvNet is a :term:`MATLAB` toolbox implementing
        :term:`Convolutional Neural Networks <Convolutional Neural Network>` for
        computer vision applications. It can store trained model in a ".mat"
        file.

    MATLAB
        MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing
        environment and proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks.

    Neural Network
        Set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are
        designed to recognize patterns.

    Vgg19
        VGG-19 is a :term:`Convolutional Neural Network` that is trained on more
         than a million images from the ImageNet database.
